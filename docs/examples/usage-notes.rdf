          The MAPPE model is a collection of ArcGIS raster calculations, 
          originally implemented in VBA for ArcGIS 9.x; as this environment 
          is obsolete, the author recommends to develop the calculations 
          anew just by picking the syntax from the reports. Anyway, the 
          value of the work is in the data and concept more than in the 
          original scripts. In order to facilitate running calculations, 
          all formulas for the European scale version are in a 'formulas.cfg' 
          file (search either in the catalogue within the project MAPPE the 
          'Formula' Dataset, or in the FTP folder under 
          \MAPPE\MAPPE_Europe\LATEST the file 'formula.cfg').
          Finally, also an Excel workbook with a list of chemicals and 
          associated physic-chemical properties that can be used as a 
          starting point for calculations is provided, (this dataset, 
          search also in the FTP folder under \MAPPE\MAPPE_Europe\LATEST 
          the file 'chemicals.xls'). For additional information see 
          related publications
